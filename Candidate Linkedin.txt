EDUCATION
King's College London | London, UK
B.Sc. in Chemistry with Biomedicine with Placement (Sept 2021 â€“ Sept 2025)

MSc in AI Applications and Innovation at Imperial College London this October! ðŸŽ“

From my previous experience at Pfizer, I've been fascinated by how AI is changing everything from healthcare to climate research, and this program feels like the perfect chance to actually dive in and learn how to build solutions that matter. What drew me in is how it combines the technical side (machine learning, deep learning) with real business applications and entrepreneurship.

The fact that Imperial was just ranked #1 in the UK for research impact and has more "world-leading" research than any other university definitely didn't hurt in my decision. The program is run through their flagship I-X initiative, bringing together their top departments in Computing, Engineering, Math, and Business with access to some seriously cool labs like the Dyson Robotics Lab.

But honestly, what I'm most excited about is working on actual AI projects with a small cohort of people who are just as curious about this stuff as I am. Being able to nerd out with likeminded people with in an environment that cherrishes innovation and entrepreneurship. Plus there's the option to do an industry internship, which could be a game-changer for my career.

Looking forward to meeting people who are thinking about the same big questions around AI and innovation. If you're working in this space, would love to connect and share ideas.

12 months of intensive learning, building real solutions, and hopefully making some great connections along the way!

Some other information about me (please only view role specific information)

Question 1: What excites you most about working in Digital Consulting, and how does this align with your own goals?

"What really gets me excited is solving problems with digital tools and apply it in sectors that needs me the most. I was a placement digital chemist in Pfizer initially, redundancy, it me realised that Pfizerâ€™s biggest bottleneck at that time was workflow management being an outdated 15 years excel spreadsheet .   When I built GROWMAT at Pfizer, to bring full stack development software for workload management and analytics tool to a dated regulatory space, I watched 80+ colleagues go from wasting hundreds of hours on manual work to focusing on what they're actually good at.

That moment when you see technology genuinely make someone's job better, it hits different - that's what I'm after.  and subsequently hired on for contract work as a product owner

 I thrive in the idea pitching, market research, making MVPs, talking to stateholders environment, development environment, project management. It bings me genuine joy to advice people on what has worked for me in the pst 


Question 2: How will you ensure efficient time management between work commitments and studying?
"I've actually been juggling work and study for the past year and a half at Pfizer while finishing my degree, so I've got some experience with this. The key for me has been finding where they overlap rather than treating them as separate things.

What's exciting is that my Masters in AI Applications and Innovation at Imperial is designed around real business applications. There's this module called AI Ventures where we build actual AI products and pitch them to venture capitalists - that's exactly the mindset I need for consulting clients about their digital strategy. When I'm learning about AI implementation challenges in class, I can directly apply that to helping RSM clients understand what actually works versus what's just hype.

The program connects with Imperial's startup-heavy environment, so I'm constantly thinking about how technology creates business value. 

I'm a bit of a tech enthusiast - I'll stay up late coding just for fun anyway, so studying feels less like extra work and more like feeding my curiosity. My approach is pretty simple: I block out dedicated study time like any important meeting, I use weekends for deeper learning, and honestly, when you're genuinely excited about what you're studying, it doesn't feel like a chore.
The technical skills I'm learning will make me better at my day job, and the consulting work will give me real context for my studies. It's not about managing competing priorities - it's about making sure everything builds on everything else."

Question 3: Would you describe yourself as someone who enjoys being given a lot of responsibility, and why?

"Yes, definitely. But not because I want to be in charge of everything - more because for me, it usually means I can take ownership and responsibility of my own decisions and actions.Im never afraid to ask for help and never ashamed to admit my fault. I am here to learn and contribute. 

The GROWMAT project is probably the best example. I saw this inefficient process that was frustrating everyone, and instead of just complaining about it, I got the chance to actually do something. Convincing senior director, building a team, managing the technical development - all of that came with immense pressure, 2am coding sessions late meetings with the US time. But after wards, I cannot be more proud of myself for pushing though, seeing what I can achieve. We never know our true potential if we arenâ€™t risk takers. 

Same thing happened in Singapore at the Civil Defence Force. Managing operations readiness for simulated national emergencies over a thousand people during COVID was intense, frightening even. Being trusted by my commander, obtaining service excellence reward, made it all worth it

What I've learned is that responsibility isn't just about being accountable when things go wrong, its also about being trusted to help clients make the right call, not just present options and let someone else decide." 

And if you dont take the chance, make mistakes, disappoint people, mess up a few times, how are you going to learn to be better? 

Question 4: How do you feel about incorporating new technologies How might your role benefit from digital enhancements?
From my perspective, new technology should solve real problems, not create new ones. At Pfizer, I didn't build GROWMAT because I thought we needed more software - I built it because people were wasting hours every day on manual tasks. Same principle applies here.

What excites me about digital approach is that you're using technology to help consultants be better consultants, not to replace them. Take something like the AI-powered tax platform you launched - that's not about cutting jobs, it's about letting tax professionals focus on strategy instead of data entry.

In my role, I see digital tools helping in two main ways. First, better data analysis means I can spot patterns and insights faster, which means better recommendations for clients. Second, automation of routine tasks means more time for the interesting work - understanding client challenges, developing solutions, actually helping businesses transform.
The key is making sure any new technology actually improves outcomes for clients. RSM's track record suggests you get this - you're using AI to deliver better results, not just because it's trendy."
